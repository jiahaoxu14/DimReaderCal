# DimReader

## Prerequisites
### Python 3
DimReader was created for Python3.  It may work on Python2 but this has not been tested. 
### Numpy
DimReader currently uses numpy version 1.15.2 but other versions should work. 

## Overview

This repository provides the source code for DimReader.  The full paper can be found at https://rjfaust.github.io/DimReader.pdf

DimReader offers 3 methods:
    
    1. DimReader: The user provides a perturbation for each point and it calculates the effect of perturbing each point in the specified way.

    2. Tangent Map Recovery: The calculation of the entire tangent map for a given dataset and projection.

    3. Perturbation Discovery: The calculation of the perturbation that changes the projection the most (requires the tangent map).

## Running DimReader
DimReader can be run with the command

```
python DimReader.py dataFile.csv perturbationFile.csv projection [optional parameters]
```

The command to run dimreader on the iris dataset is

```
python DimReader.py Examples/iris.csv Examples/irisPerturb.csv tsne 30
```


### Data File
 Should be in CSV format and all data should be numeric. An example can be found at Examples/iris.csv

### Perturbation File
 A csv where each line is the perturbation for the corresponding point.  In a row (perturbation), there should be a value for each dimension of the original data.  For example, if the data point is [1,2,3,4] the corresponding row of the perturbation file might look like "1,0,0,0".

If you would like run DimReader once for each dimension (perturbing the data points in that dimension), enter "all" instead of a perturbation file. An example is shown below.

```
python DimReader.py Examples/iris.csv all tsne 30
```
This will return a .dimreader file where each point takes the form

{
    "domain": original point
    "range": projected point
    "inputPert": The best perturbation for that point
    "outputPert": the resulting perturbation on the output
}


### Projections


Currently, only two types of projections are supported:

    1. tSNE 
    Paremters: Perplexity (default = 20), 
        Number of iterations (default 1000), 
        Number of Dimensions to project to (default 2)

    2. Projection from the Tangent Map 


### Optional Parameters
Some projections have user tunable paramters. If that is the case, those parameters must be entered in the order that they are shown in the description (it will read them in in that order).  For example, for tSNE, if we want to specify the number of iterations, we first have to enter the perplexity. 

### Plotting
The projection can be plotted by opening Plotting/index.html and uploading the .dimreader file into it.  The axis lines can be turned on and off, as well as the output vectors.   


## Running Tangent Map Recovery
The command to recover the tangent map is

```
python TangentMap.py dataFile projection [optional parameters]
```

The command to calculate the Tangent map of the iris dataset is

```
python TangentMap.py Examples/iris.csv tsne 30
```

All of the command parameters are the same as those used in the DimReader command (above). 

The output .tmap file (as shown in Examples/iris_TangentMap_tsne.tmap) is a JSON where each point takes the form 

{
    "domain": original point
    "range": projected point
    "tangent": 2xm map from the tangent of the original point to the tangent of the projected point
}

## Running Perturbation Discovery
Perturbation Discovery finds the perturbation that changes the projection the most under the constraints:

    1. The perturbation for each point should be the one that maximizes the change in the projected point

    2. Points that are projected to similar places should be perturbed in similar ways



The command to run perturbation discovery is 

```
python PertrubationDiscovery.py tangentMapFile.tmap sigma lambda [optional which_vector]
```

To recover the best perturbation from the iris dataset run the command

```
python PertrubationDiscovery.py iris_TangentMap_tsne.tmap 10 30 0
```

It will return a .dimreader file where each point takes the form

{
    "domain": original point
    "range": projected point
    "inputPert": The best perturbation for that point
    "outputPert": the resulting perturbation on the output
}

### Tangent Map File
The tangent map file should be a file created by running the Tangent Map Recovery (discussed above)

### Sigma
Sigma is a similarity parameter that is used to decide how similar two projected points are.  The similarity equation is

![Simliarity Equation](/images/similarity.png  "Similarity Equation")

Sigma, in the denominator of the exponent, determines how close projected points have to be to be considered similar. Further details are given in the paper.

### Lambda
Lambda is a parameter to determine how much smoothing we want.  Details of how this parameter is used are given in the paper. 

### Which Vector
The perturbation discovery boils down to an eigenvalue problem where the first eiegenvector is the perturbation that changes the projection the most. However, other eigenvectors may contain interesting information so the user can specify which perturbation vector they want to see (from 0 to n-1). By default, this is 0.
